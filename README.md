# Predict daily bike rental ridership | Neural Network

### A simple neural network demonstrating forward propagation (backpropagation provided) for predicting daily bike rental ridership. 

This is the first project in Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). The program covers topics like Keras and TensorFlow, convolutional and recurrent networks, deep reinforcement learning, and GANs. 

I implemented forward pass through the network, setting the hyperparameters, the learning rate, the number of hidden units, and the number of training passes, to train the network and then check it against the predictions. 
The goal was to tune the hyperparameters to minimize training loss while not overfitting the data. In the final step, the neural network was compared for accuracy against the prediction.
